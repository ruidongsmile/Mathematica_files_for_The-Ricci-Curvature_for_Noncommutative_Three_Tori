# Mathematica_files_for_The-Ricci-Curvature_for_Noncommutative_Three_Tori

These are the Mathematica files of the computation of scalar curvature and ricci curvature of noncommutative 3-tori.
The results are presented in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02977.
These are joint work with Professor Asghar Ghorbanpour and Professor Masoud Khalkhali.
